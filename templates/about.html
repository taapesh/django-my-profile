                <h3><i class="fa fa-terminal"></i> The beginning</h3>
                <p>
                    I started programming during my second year at the University of Texas at Austin. I took two entry level classes, introduction to algorithms and introduction to programming in Python. My only regret is not discovering programming sooner, but there is something to be said for finding it on my own. Within a couple of weeks of class and learning the basics, I was writing a Texas Hold'em poker bot. It was decent but it could only beat poor to average players. I had no idea what I was getting into, but I was foolish and eager to learn.
                </p>
                <h3><i class="fa fa-terminal"></i> Eager to learn</h3>
                <p>
                    University did a great job of laying the foundation for programming but the curriculum did not even scratch the surface of what was possible. For the projects I wanted to do, I would have to learn a lot on my own. It did not take long to find a trove of online resources in the form of articles, videos, and stackoverflow. Now, if I'm not actively coding, I'll be brainstorming what to write next or learning a new technology.
                </p>
                <h3><i class="fa fa-terminal"></i> Software</h3>
                <p>
                    In my quest to try everything, I have learned a lot of different technologies. I started like most everyone else with basic programs that printed stuff to the terminal. Then, I started making desktop apps with GUIs in Python. I messed around with 3d games for awhile using Unity3d and C#. Web development came after that with Django, learning about MVC, and also about cloud computing like AWS and Heroku. Usually, I just take my current interest, such as Poker, or Bitcoin, and incorporate it into whatever technology I am learning. Soon after web apps, I started learning about mobile development with Android because I was already comfortable with Java. I quickly found out that many successful apps today are powered by a RESTful API and while I was already consuming third party APIs, I had never considered building my own until this point. I took the plunge and learned about the fundamentals of HTTP requests and Token based authentication. Now when I am starting a new project, designing the API is one of the first things I do.
                </p>
                <h3><i class="fa fa-terminal"></i> Today and tomorrow</h3>
                <p>
                    Most recently, I have been learning about Node.js and the MEAN stack (MongoDB, Express.js, Angular.js, Node.js). I have also been trying to wrap my head around RxJava. I will probably be coding and learning in some capacity for the rest of my life. Looking back to the time when I was working on that poker bot and first learning how to code, so many things have changed. Back then, I didn't know 1% of what I know now. And tomorrow, I'll know more than I know today. Some things have not changed, though. I still get a rush when turning on my computer to work on a project that could reach millions of people. And, despite everything that I have learned, I feel that I am still foolish and more eager to learn than ever.

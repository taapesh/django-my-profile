                        <h3><i class="fa fa-terminal"></i> The Beginning</h3>
                        <p>
                            I started programming during my second year of college. I was not sure if I would like computer science, so I took two entry level classes: a basic algorithms class and an intro to programming class using Python. It was the door to a whole new world. Pretty soon, I was exploring the possibilities. Being a poker player, I started by writing a Nash equilibrium poker bot in Python that was decent, but it could only beat average players. Then, I tried to turn that poker bot into a game using Python. At that time, I had no idea what I was getting into, but I was foolish and hungry.
                        </p>
                        <h3><i class="fa fa-terminal"></i> Foolish and Hungry</h3>
                        <p>
                            It did not take long for me to discover the thriving online community of programmers. Endless articles, videos, and stackoverflow answers; everything I needed to learn was available. University did a great job of laying the foundation for programming but the curriculum did not even begin to scratch the surface of what was possible. To satisfy my craving, I had to constantly seek out new projects and learn new technologies. Back then, and still today, I rarely question whether an idea is possible. The fastest answer is to just try it, and more often than not, the answer is yes.
                        </p>
                        <h3><i class="fa fa-terminal"></i> Games</h3>
                        <p>
                            Games were a big influence on me during my formative years. They offered entertainment, an escape from reality, and they strengthened my friendships. Today, games are just a source of nostalgia for me. But, through programming, I could now create my own games and potentially give another person the same feeling I had as a child. I did some research and chose the Unity3d game engine while learning C#. I made several proof of concepts and then decided to start building a serious game, some sort of strange fantasy-chess hybrid. The game had to be online, so I learned about some networking fundamentals, RPCs and such. This introduced all kinds of frustrating new bugs that I squashed one by one until I had a working prototype. Once I was satisfied with the progress and the game was working, I moved on to other things. Finishing this game and releasing it is now one of my life goals.

                        <h3><i class="fa fa-terminal"></i> Software Engineering</h3>
                        <p>
                            In recent years, I have witnessed an explosion of new technology and startups. It was all very inspiring so I started down the path of software engineering. I started with a basic desktop application written in Python. This app had a GUI and its purpose was to manage a user's private information by integrating with Google Drive. The project was simple and fun but it felt limited. I turned my attention to web development. I chose Python initially due to familiarity and I learned about web frameworks and the model view controller (MVC) pattern. I started with the web2py framework but quickly learned about Django and I took the plunge. Around this time, I was also messing with Bitcoin, so I decided to build a site for users to post tasks or complete tasks for other users in exchange for Bitcoin. It used the Block.io API to store the Bitcoin and perform the transactions. The next logical step was learning how to show my websites to my friends and the world. I learned about IaaS and PaaS (Infrastructure/Platform as a service) such as AWS and Heroku. I chose Heroku so that I could develop and deploy faster (also, 5 free apps). When I started using the Heroku CLI, I discovered that the whole process of building a website and deploying it from the terminal could be automated. So, I put together some Python and Bash scripts that would build any kind of website, inject any kind of template, and deploy the site to Heroku automatically using just one command.

                        <h3><i class="fa fa-terminal"></i> Android</h3>
                        <p>
                            In my quest to try everything, I picked up Android next as I was already familiar with Java. Through a combination of articles and videos, I learned Android fundamentals and started hacking away on various projects. I had an idea for an app that allowed users to scan products in stores, view the product's information, and ultimately check out (pay) from their phone. I got the scanner working and hooked it up with some APIs with access to massive product databases. I pitched the idea around and the glaring flaw was preventing theft using this system. Not that theft doesn't already occur, it's just that my app would make it easier to steal. So I put that aside and continued building other apps. One of my current projects is Tablemate, which will streamline the process of dining in restaurants, allowing people to order food, request table service, and pay the bill using their phone. It's not a novel idea, but I believe I could design it better than anyone else.

                        <h3><i class="fa fa-terminal"></i> RESTful</h3>
                        <p>
                            While working on these mobile and web apps, one phrase came up over and over: RESTful API. Eventually, I couldn't ignore it anymore and I had to learn what it was and how to use it. The barrier to entry was relatively high compared to other technologies I had learned. There was a lot of material to learn. But, once I figured it out, I regretted not learning it sooner. I was familiar with Django already, so I used a nifty toolkit called Django Rest Framework and built a basic API for my Tablemate app. Now, I love building APIs from scratch and designing the API is one of the first things I consider when starting on a new project.
                        </p>
                        <h3><i class="fa fa-terminal"></i> Today</h3>
                        <p>
                            As it turns out, I enjoy every kind of programming including mobile apps, web apps, APIs, backend, and frontend. Most recently, I have been learning about Node.js, specically the MEAN stack (MongoDB, Express.js, Angular.js, Node.js). This is just another way of building web apps and APIs besides Python and Django. I will probably be coding and learning in some capacity for the rest of my life. Looking back to the time when I was working on that poker bot and first learning to code, so many things have changed. Back then, I didn't know 1% of what I know now. And tomorrow, I'll know more than I do today. That's the important thing and the only thing that hasn't changed. I'm still foolish and I'm still hungry.
